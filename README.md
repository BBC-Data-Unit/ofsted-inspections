In September 2019 we [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-49579520) that more than 1,000 schools in England hadn't been inspected by Ofsted in more than a decade. And 24 have now gone over 13 years since their last inspection.

It stems from a government decision back in 2011, that took effect from 2012, to exempt "outstanding" schools from re-inspection.

That's going to change amid concerns that some schools may no longer be at the standard they were when they were given the top rating.

We worked out the time since inspection by going for the most recent of either a long or short inspection and then the time elapsed since.
